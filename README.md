how to use?

1. run modelUse.py (for default it will run in port 8000, as the communication happens via API)
2. run the jacamo file in \slmAgent\slmAgentMAS\slmAgentMAS.jcm (recommend using the JaCaMo CLI as gradlew can be buggy (jacamo-lang.github.io/jacamo/install.html))
3. in the bob agent console, run getTranslation("sentence").


the model used for this test is rhaymison/opus-en-to-pt-translator via HUGGING FACE
